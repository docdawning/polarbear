# PolarBear
Here's my little repo for my "PolarBear" Delta Printer. This is totally a "BigDelta" style printer. I've modified some parts for printability with my current printer. I'm posting this to github more for myself than others, but someone out there may find this useful, so here ya go. If you do use it, please drop me a line, as it'd just be nice to know it helped someone.

My original STL files came from here: https://github.com/justinledwards/BigDelta
I edited them using Autodesk Meshmixer.
